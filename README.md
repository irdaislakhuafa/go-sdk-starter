This project includes setup for:
- SQL Query Builder using [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)
- SMTP Client using [gomail](https://github.com/go-gomail/gomail)
- Rest API Server with [fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)
- SDK Library from [go-sdk](https://github.com/irdaislakhuafa/go-sdk)

- [Development](#development)
- [Run and Build](#run-and-build)

### Installation

A simple way to using this project, you just need to clone this project and custom setup based on your purpose.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/irdaislakhuafa/go-sdk-starter.git
```

### Development
Big Thanks for [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) and [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) the awesome project for developer.

This project includes bundle with development tools for Go project:
- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix): A simple code editor but powerfull like vim/neovim.
- [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls): Golang language server protocol that provide auto completion and etc.
- [gotools](https://go.googlesource.com/tools): Golang tools collection for development that provide formatter, auto import and etc. 
- [go](https://github.com/golang/go): Golang compiler with version 1.24.
- [simple-completion-language-server](https://github.com/estin/simple-completion-language-server): A language server for text buffer.

#### Full Setup
Full setup contains all tools above for development. For usage you need to install [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) package manager first. Then just type below:

```bash
$ nix develop .#ide
```

And [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) will setup development environment for Go and you ready to develop your app without any effort to setup compiler or etc.

### Minimal Setup
May you need minimal setup if you:
- already have own `go` compiler installed.
- want to use your own `ide` or `code editor`.
- don't need auto complete for plain text from buffer.

And just need a minimal setup to develop your Go app you can type.

```bash
$ nix develop .#ide-minimal
```

This setup only contains:
- `gopls`
- `gotools`


After that you can open your project using `helix`.
```bash
$ hx .
```

Or using any IDE that you like.

### Run and Build
Build your app.
```bash
$ go build -o main ./src/cmd/main.go
```

Run the app.
```bash
$ ./main
```

Build with docker.
```bash
$ docker compose up app-dev -d
```
or
```bash
$ docker compose up app-prod -d
```
Depends about your [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml) configurations.

## Todo

[x] Setup nix flake
[x] Setup SQL Query Builder using sqlc.
[x] Setup for Rest API
[ ] Setup for GraphQL
[ ] Setup for gRPC
